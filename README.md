# Communify
- The idea is to create an app, which have two parts speaker(host) and listeners. So, whenever the listener needs to ask doubt or interact with host it can raise hand in the app, or use hand gesture to ask doubt. 

- The app will also serve, the person who are disabled, can’t interact and miss important session, so we can use hand gesture-to-speech, wherein, a speech-impaired person could convey their messages using gestures on their smartphone’s front camera and it’d get converted to voice in real-time.

- Moreover the hearing-impaired person can see the text spoken on their mobile screen, using speech to text converter.

- It also happens that many a time there is language gap, so we can give a choice either to do translation of words from host language to listener language or to do transliteration, example Hinglish, as most time hindi is difficult to read, but hinglish can be easily read and understand.
